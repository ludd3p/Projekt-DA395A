## Project description: F1 Race Statistics
This project is a web application and the final project for the course DA395A at Malm√∂ University.
The application allows users to browse all individual F1 races on a set year by selecting a year from a dropdown menu.

## About the project
The project is built using TypeScript, and Next.js which is an extension of the React framework.
The main reasons we chose to use Next.js over Angular or Vue are:
- It is a React framework, and we are more familiar with React than Angular or Vue.
- As React has the largest community, it is easier to find solutions to problems we encounter.
- React is currently the most popular framework with the most job openings, and as such it would be of higher value to learn it compared to the others.
- Next.js has one of the highest user satisfaction ratings of all frameworks, and is the most popular React framework.
- Angular could have been a choice as it used in many existing applications, has a lot of job openings and is more object oriented which we are more familiar with. However, it's popularity is declining and it has very low user satisfaction compared the other frameworks.
